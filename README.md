#Adafruit 10(+1) Degrees of Freedom Breakout Library #

This driver is for the Adafruit 10DOF Breakout (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1604), and makes use of Adafruit's Unified Sensor Library (Adafruit_Sensor).

For information about this breakout and how to use this library, consult our online learning guide at http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-10-dof-imu-breakout-lsm303-l3gd20-bmp180/introduction

## About the 10DOF Breakout ##

Adafruit's 10DOF Breakout includes everything you need for accurate, meaningful motion capture and detection, including the following sensors:

- L3GD20 3-axis gyroscope: ±250, ±500, or ±2000 degree-per-second scale
- LSM303 3-axis compass: ±1.3 to ±8.1 gauss magnetic field scale
- LSM303 3-axis accelerometer: ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g selectable scale
- BMP180 barometric pressure/temperature: -40 to 85 °C, 300 - 1100hPa range, 0.17m resolution

## Adafruit_10DOF Library ##

The Adafruit_10DOF library makes use of Adafruit's existing libraries for the L3GD20, LSM303DLHC and BMP180, but also adds a few helper functions to generate values that are more useful for drones, motion detection, etc.
